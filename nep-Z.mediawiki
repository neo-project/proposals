==Abstract==

This proposal describes the callback method used by Neo smart contracts to
process transfers of fungible [[nep-17.mediawiki|NEP-17]] tokens to their addresses.

==Motivation==

While the original [[nep-17.mediawiki|NEP-17]] already defines this method, it
lacks some details relevant specifically to the receiver contract and it doesn't
allow for easy reference. This standard can be used in <code>supportedstandards</code>
section of [[nep-15.mediawiki|NEP-15 manifest]] or in any other situation to
refer to contracts able to receive [[nep-17.mediawiki|NEP-17]] tokens (but not
necessarily being [[nep-17.mediawiki|NEP-17]] themselves). Typical use cases
for this functionality are: depositing/staking (with contract locking and
managing tokens according to some rules) or exchange/minting (contract accepting
transfer to itself, but returning some different token to the sender).

==Specification==

Smart contracts that need to receive and own [[nep-17.mediawiki|NEP-17]] tokens
MUST implement <code>onNEP17Payment</code> method with the following signature:

<pre>
{
  "name": "onNEP17Payment",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "from",
      "type": "Hash160"
    },
    {
      "name": "amount",
      "type": "Integer"
    },
    {
      "name": "data",
      "type": "Any"
    }
  ],
  "returntype": "Void"
}
</pre>

A contract that doesn't implement this method will not be able to receive
[[nep-17.mediawiki|NEP-17]] tokens (transfers to its address will fail). This
method is called by [[nep-17.mediawiki|NEP-17]] contracts which tokens are being
transferred. A particular token can be obtained via the <code>System.Runtime.GetCallingScriptHash</code>
system call. Contracts SHOULD check for this hash to match their expectations
like allowed/accepted tokens, processing this call means that contract trusts
the caller to implement [[nep-17.mediawiki|NEP-17]] correctly.

<code>from</code> parameter specifies the sender of tokens and can be <code>null</code>
for minted tokens.

<code>amount</code> is the amount of tokens transferred to the contract.

<code>data</code> is the same <code>data</code>parameter that was given to the
[[nep-17.mediawiki|NEP-17]] <code>transfer</code> call. Contract can interpret
it in any application-specific way including imposing any restrictions on
accepted <code>data</code> contents.

If the contract implementing this NEP can't accept the transfer (for reasons like
unexpected token, wrong amount, forbidden sender, wrong <code>data</code>
parameter or any other) it MUST call <code>ABORT</code> or <code>ABORTMSG</code>
VM opcode to fail the transaction. This is the only way to ensure contract
won't own transferred tokens, because the method doesn't return any value
and exceptions can be handled by calling contract.

==Rationale==

This NEP just follows and explains [[nep-17.mediawiki|NEP-17]] semantics, no
design decisions made here.

==Backwards Compatibility==

This NEP is completely compatible with [[nep-17.mediawiki|NEP-17]], the only
extension is <code>ABORTMSG</code> that didn't exist at the time of
[[nep-17.mediawiki|NEP-17]] creation, but it's the same thing semantically.
