==Abstract==

A <code>NefFile</code> is a file meeting the standard format for a valid NEO executable file. It provides the basic information about the script, including the compiler and version.

This NEP describes the NEF standard for NEO smart contracts.

==Motivation==

Although we use neo-vm as the virtual machine currently, we should have other scripts in the future. A standard definition for the executable file format can guarantee both the feasibility of other vm code and the validity of the script file.

==Specification==

In the field definitions below, we provide both the definitions of the fields as well as the corresponding functions.

==NefFile Structure==

A <code>nef</code> file consists of a single <code>NefFile</code> structure:

{| class="wikitable sortable" style="width: auto; text-align: center; font-size: smaller; table-layout: fixed;"
!<nowiki>#</nowiki>
!size
!item
|-
| 1
| 4 bytes
| magic
|-
| 2
| 32 bytes
| compile
|-
| 3
| 16 bytes
| version
|-
| 4
| var bytes
| abi
|-
| 5
| var bytes
| script
|}

===magic===

The <code>magic</code> item supplies the magic number identifying the <code>NEF3</code> file format; it has the value <code>0x3346454E</code>.

===compiler===

The <code>compile</code> is a UTF-8 encoded <code>string</code> representing the human readable name of the compiler used to create the data in the <code>script</code> item. Its length is limited to 32 bytes. The name is right side padded by zero's if shorter than 32 bytes.

===version===

The value of <code>version</code> item is determined by a major version number M, a minor version number m, a build number x and a revision number y, each of which is a signed four-byte quantity. Thus we can denote the version of its <code>NefFile</code> as M.m.x.y.

===abi===

The <code>abi</code> item gives a complete description of an application binary interface (ABI) of the smart contract. The format of the <code>ABI</code> structure is defined in the [https://github.com/neo-project/proposals/pull/119/files].

===script===

The value of <code>script</code> stores the raw VM opcodes. The data should be serialised using the variable length format as described in the [https://docs.neo.org/developerguide/en/articles/conventions.html#variable-length-types documentation].
