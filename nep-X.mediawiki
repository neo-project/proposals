==Abstract==

Massive decentralization has the cost of safety.
It is impossible to deny that in unlucky cases `M` (safety level) nodes can be Byzantine and attack the Blockchain.
While there are different types of possible attacks, some of them are easy to detect, such as: 1- blocks with wrong transactions; and 2- blocks with double-spending.
Considering this possibility, this NEP proposes a simple deep-reorganization mechanism in which consensus nodes that signed the Byzantine Block are banned.
For ensuring safety by economic means, all consensus nodes will stake NEO (similar to what is done today) are may lose them in case of being Byzantine.


==Motivation and Rationale==

After https://github.com/neo-project/neo/pull/426 is merged it is believed that no more natural forks will occur on the network.
Then, some additional safety mechanism should be implemented in order to boost massive decentralization.

==Specification==

A new message should be added, in which nodes can report the byzantine blocks.
Initially, there will be two types of possible bans:

* If the block contains wrong transactions all nodes that signed that blocked are automatically banned, removed as validators and losing their stake;
* If two/more blocks on a same height are reported, the longer branch (with, at least, more than `X` blocks. `X` should be defined in a safety manner. Maybe 2 blocks could be enough) will be defined as the correct chain and all signatures from the other branches will be banned.

In both cases the Blockchain will be deep reorganized and re-synced.

==Backwards Compatibility==

This NEP requires a height definition where it will start, otherwise an attack can be done used any previous fault of the network.
