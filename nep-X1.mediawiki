==Abstract==

This proposal standardizes the destroy function which is necessary for contract storage deletion.

==Motivation==

N3 already provided contract destroy mechanism but it hasn't been summarized in a standard. This standard will show details.

==Specification==

Neo N3 has the native <code>ContractManagement</code> contract that is responsible for contract destruction via its <code>destroy</code> method. When <code>destroy</code> is executed, it will delete all storage entries of this contract. It will block the contract address using the native <code>Policy</code> contract to prevent redeployment or calling any methods on the contract from that point forward. The user smart contract should implement the <code>destroy</code> method as described below.

===Methods===

====destroy====

<pre>
{
  "name": "destroy",
  "safe": false,
  "parameters": [],
  "returntype": "Void"
}
</pre>
This method MUST invoke the <code>destroy</code> method of <code>ContractManagement</code> contract when the contract is destroyed.

===Events===

====Destroy====

<pre>
{
  "name": "Destroy",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "contract",
      "type": "Hash160"
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

<code>Destroy</code>notification will be emitted automatically by native <code>ContractManagement</code> contract as well. It will notify contract hash in event.
