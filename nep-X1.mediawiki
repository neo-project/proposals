==Abstract==

This proposal standardizes the destroy function which is necessary for contract storage deletion.

==Motivation==

N3 already provided contract destroy mechanism but it hasn't been summarized in a standard. This standard will show details.

==Specification==

Neo N3 has a native <code>ContractManagement</code> contract that is used for contract destroy via <code>destroy</code> method. When <code>destroy</code> is executed, it will callback the <code>destroy</code> method in <code>ContractManagement</code>. Finally, it will delete all storage and entries of this contract. It will block the contract address in native <code>Policy</code> contract as well.

===Methods===

====destroy====

<pre>
{
  "name": "destroy",
  "safe": false,
  "parameters": [],
  "returntype": "Void"
}
</pre>
This method will automatically invoke <code>destroy</code> method of <code>ContractManagement</code> contract when a contract is destroyed.

===Events===

====Destroy====

<pre>
{
  "name": "Destroy",
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "contract",
      "type": "Hash160"
    }
  ]
}
</pre>

<code>Destroy</code>notification will be emitted automatically by native <code>ContractManagement</code> contract as well. It will notify contract hash in event.
