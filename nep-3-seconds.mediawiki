  Type: Standard
  Status: Draft
  Created: 2025-02-11
  Replaces: N/A
  Hardfork: Echidna

==Abstract==

This NEP proposes two significant changes to the Neo N3 network parameters:
1. Enabling governance mechanism for block time adjustment via the Policy contract
2. Preparing for future reduction of block time from 15 seconds to 3 seconds
3. Preparing for future reduction of GAS generation rate per block from 5 GAS to 1 GAS

The hardfork will introduce the governance methods while maintaining current values. After the hardfork, the Neo Council will be responsible for executing the parameter changes through the governance mechanism.

==Motivation==

The primary motivations for these changes are:
1. Improve transaction throughput and user experience
2. Maintain a stable GAS/NEO ratio in the ecosystem
3. Better compete with other high-performance blockchain platforms

==Specification==

===Block Time Reduction===
* Current value: 15 seconds (15000 milliseconds)
* Initial value after hardfork: 15 seconds (15000 milliseconds)
* Target value after council update: 3 seconds (3000 milliseconds)
* Implementation: 
  * Move block time configuration from dBFT plugin to Policy native contract
  * Initially maintain current block time at hardfork activation
  * Allow the council to configure block time through the Policy contract
  * Consensus mechanism will read block time from configuration for blocks up to and including the hardfork block
  * Consensus mechanism will read block time from the Policy contract for blocks after the hardfork block

===GAS Generation Rate Reduction===
* Current value: 5 GAS per block
* Initial value after hardfork: 5 GAS per block
* Target value after council update: 1 GAS per block
* Implementation: 
  * Retain the existing governance model where council controls GasPerBlock
  * Council will adjust GasPerBlock after hardfork using existing mechanisms
  * Coordination between block time and GAS per block changes will be managed through governance

===Policy Contract Enhancement===
* New native method: `SetBlockGenTime(BigInteger milliseconds)`
  * Allows council to set block time through the Policy contract
  * **Permission restricted**: Can only be called by the Neo Council
  * **Safe**: False (requires verification)
  * Parameters:
    * `milliseconds`: The new block time in milliseconds
* New native method: `GetBlockGenTime()`
  * Returns the current block generation time
  * **Permission**: Can be called by any user or contract
  * **Safe**: True (read-only operation)
  * Returns:
    * A BigInteger representing the current block time in milliseconds

===Native Contract Interface===

The block time configuration methods will be added to the <code>PolicyContract</code> native contract in hardfork <code>Echidna</code> with the following interfaces:

<pre>
{
    "name": "SetBlockGenTime",
    "safe": false,
    "parameters": [
        {
            "name": "milliseconds",
            "type": "Integer"
        }
    ],
    "returntype": "Boolean",
    "events": [
        {
            "name": "BlockGenTimeChanged",
            "parameters": [
                {
                    "name": "oldTime",
                    "type": "Integer"
                },
                {
                    "name": "newTime", 
                    "type": "Integer"
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
</pre>

<pre>
{
    "name": "GetBlockGenTime",
    "safe": true,
    "parameters": [],
    "returntype": "Integer"
}
</pre>

===Method Specification===

The <code>SetBlockGenTime</code> method MUST follow these rules:

1. Permission Requirements:
   * MUST only be callable by the Neo Council through a committee multi-signature transaction
   * MUST fail with "Access denied" error if called by any other entity

2. Input Requirements:
   * <code>milliseconds</code> MUST be a positive integer representing block time in milliseconds
   * <code>milliseconds</code> MUST be greater than or equal to 1000 (1 second)

3. Behavior:
   * MUST update the block time configuration
   * MUST take effect immediately after the transaction is executed
   * Consensus nodes MUST use the new block time for the next consensus round
   * MUST emit an <code>Event</code> with the name "BlockGenTimeChanged" containing:
     * The previous block generation time in milliseconds
     * The new block generation time in milliseconds

4. Return Value:
   * Returns true if the operation is successful
   * Returns false if any validation fails

The <code>GetBlockGenTime</code> method MUST follow these rules:

1. Permission Requirements:
   * Can be called by any entity (contracts, users, or applications)
   * MUST be marked as "safe": true in the contract manifest to enable read-only access

2. Behavior:
   * MUST return the current block generation time in milliseconds

3. Return Value:
   * Returns an integer representing the current block time in milliseconds

5. Effect on Contracts:
   * Contract executions MUST adapt to the new block time for all time-related calculations
   * The consensus mechanism MUST read the block time from the Policy contract for each consensus round

===Permission Enforcement===

The Policy contract MUST implement strict permission enforcement:

1. For `SetBlockGenTime`:
   * The method MUST verify the caller is the Neo Council committee
   * Implementation MUST use the CheckCommittee verification pattern
   * Any unauthorized calls MUST be rejected with appropriate error codes

2. For `GetBlockGenTime`:
   * No permission checks required
   * Must be implemented as a read-only operation
   * Cannot modify blockchain state

This permission model ensures that only the governance committee can modify critical consensus parameters while providing transparent access to current settings.

===Hardfork Activation===
* The hardfork will:
  * Add the new `SetBlockGenTime` and `GetBlockGenTime` methods to the Policy contract
  * Move block time configuration from consensus settings to Policy contract
  * Initially set the default block time to 15 seconds (15000 milliseconds)
  * The consensus module behavior will change:
    * For blocks before and including the hardfork block (Ht), consensus time is read from configuration
    * For blocks after the hardfork block (Ht+1 and beyond), consensus time is read from `GetBlockGenTime()`
  * After hardfork activation, the council will be responsible for:
    * Calling `SetBlockGenTime()` to adjust the block time to the target value
    * Calling `SetGasPerBlock()` to adjust the GAS generation rate
  * Careful coordination will be needed to ensure economic balance

==Rationale==

The reduction in block time from 15000 to 3000 milliseconds will:
* Reduce transaction confirmation waiting times
* Improve DApp responsiveness and user experience
* Better compete with other high-performance blockchains

The reduction in GAS generation from 5 to 1 GAS per block will:
* Maintain economic balance despite increased block production
* Preserve the intended tokenomics of the Neo ecosystem
* Prevent potential GAS oversupply and value dilution

== Affected Configurations ==

* Block Time Configuration:
  * Current: Hardcoded in consensus settings (MillisecondsPerBlock: 15000)
  * After hardfork: Configurable via Policy contract with initial value of 15000 (15 seconds)
  * Target after council update: 3000 (3 seconds)
* MaxTransactionsPerBlock: 512 => 256
* GasPerBlock: 
  * Current: 5 GAS
  * After hardfork: Remains at 5 GAS until configured by council
  * Target after council update: 1 GAS
* MaxValidUntilBlockIncrement: 100 => 500

==Backwards Compatibility==

This change requires a hard fork as it modifies fundamental network parameters. All nodes must upgrade to maintain network consensus.

==Test Cases==

The following scenarios should be tested:
1. Network stability under 3-second block times
2. Transaction processing under high load
3. Node synchronization with faster blocks
4. GAS generation and distribution accuracy
5. Smart contract execution under new timing constraints

==Potential Issues and Mitigations==

1. Network Stability
* Issue: Faster block times may increase network overhead
* Mitigation: Implement improved network optimization and node requirements

2. Smart Contract Timing
* Issue: Some contracts may assume 15-second blocks
* Mitigation: Provide migration guidelines and testing framework

3. Network Synchronization
* Issue: Faster blocks may impact node sync speed
* Mitigation: Implement enhanced sync protocols

4. Governance Coordination
* Issue: Non-atomic updates between block time and GAS generation rate
* Mitigation: Careful governance coordination to adjust both settings in close succession

5. Contract Dependency on Block Time
* Issue: Contracts relying on block time for time-related calculations will be affected
* Mitigation: Documentation and tools to help developers update affected contracts

==Implementation==

The implementation requires modifications to:
1. Policy native contract to add the new `SetBlockGenTime` and `GetBlockGenTime` methods
2. Consensus mechanism to read block time:
   * From configuration for blocks up to and including the hardfork block
   * From Policy contract (`GetBlockGenTime()`) for blocks after the hardfork block
3. Neo native contract to coordinate with the new timing system

A phased implementation approach is recommended:
1. TestNet deployment and testing (2 weeks)
2. MainNet deployment preparation (2 weeks)
3. Hard fork coordination and execution
4. Council governance actions after hardfork:
   * Call `SetBlockGenTime(3000)` to set new block time
   * Adjust GasPerBlock to 1 GAS using existing governance mechanisms
