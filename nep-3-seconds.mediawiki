  Title: Reduce Block Time and Gas Generation Rate

  Type: Standard
  Status: Draft
  Created: 2025-02-11
  Replaces: N/A
  Hardfork: Echidna

==Abstract==

This NEP proposes two significant changes to the Neo N3 network parameters:
1. Reducing the block time from 15 seconds to 3 seconds
2. Reducing the GAS generation rate per block from 5 GAS to 1 GAS

==Motivation==

The primary motivations for these changes are:
1. Improve transaction throughput and user experience
2. Maintain a stable GAS/NEO ratio in the ecosystem
3. Better compete with other high-performance blockchain platforms

==Specification==

===Block Time Reduction===
* Current value: 15 seconds
* Proposed value: 3 seconds
* Implementation: Modify the block time in dBFT plugin

===GAS Generation Rate Reduction===
* Current value: 5 GAS per block
* Proposed value: 1 GAS per block
* Implementation: 
  * Modify the native Neo contract to include hardcoded upgrade logic
  * At hardfork height, automatically apply 1/5 reduction to GasPerBlock
  * This reduction remains in effect until council explicitly sets a new value
  * Ensures stable GAS generation rate immediately after hardfork
* Governance:
  * Council retains ability to adjust GasPerBlock
  * Any new value set by council will override the hardfork reduction
  * Prevents potential GAS minting instability during the upgrade

===Hardfork Activation===

==Rationale==

The reduction in block time from 15 to 3 seconds will:
* Reduce transaction confirmation waiting times
* Improve DApp responsiveness and user experience
* Better compete with other high-performance blockchains

The reduction in GAS generation from 5 to 1 GAS per block will:
* Maintain economic balance despite increased block production
* Preserve the intended tokenomics of the Neo ecosystem
* Prevent potential GAS oversupply and value dilution

== Affected Configurations ==

* MillisecondsPerBlock: 15000 => 3000
* MaxTransactionsPerBlock: 512 => 256
* GasPerBlock: 
  * Current: 5 GAS
  * At hardfork: Automatically reduced to 1 GAS
  * Post-hardfork: Configurable by council
* MaxValidUntilBlockIncrement: 100 => 500?

==Backwards Compatibility==

This change requires a hard fork as it modifies fundamental network parameters. All nodes must upgrade to maintain network consensus.

==Test Cases==

The following scenarios should be tested:
1. Network stability under 3-second block times
2. Transaction processing under high load
3. Node synchronization with faster blocks
4. GAS generation and distribution accuracy
5. Smart contract execution under new timing constraints

==Potential Issues and Mitigations==

1. Network Stability
* Issue: Faster block times may increase network overhead
* Mitigation: Implement improved network optimization and node requirements

2. Node Requirements
* Issue: Higher hardware requirements for validators
* Mitigation: Phase implementation to allow gradual node upgrades

3. Smart Contract Timing
* Issue: Some contracts may assume 15-second blocks
* Mitigation: Provide migration guidelines and testing framework

4. Network Synchronization
* Issue: Faster blocks may impact node sync speed
* Mitigation: Implement enhanced sync protocols

==Implementation==

The implementation requires modifications to:
1. Core consensus mechanism
2. Native Neo contract
3. dBFT plugin

A phased implementation approach is recommended:
1. TestNet deployment and testing (2 weeks)
2. MainNet deployment preparation (1 month)
3. Hard fork coordination and execution
