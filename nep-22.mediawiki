==Abstract==

This proposal outlines a standard for the Neo blockchain that will provide systems with a generalized interaction mechanism for smart contract update.

==Motivation==

As the Neo blockchain scales, Smart Contract Update will become increasingly important. We need a standard for <code>update</code> method in contract to callback native <code>ContractManagement</code> correctly.

==Specification==

All contracts SHOULD implement this NEP to be able to fix bugs or otherwise improve functionality. If no update method there, incorrect action can never be corrected.

===Methods===

====update====

<pre>
{
  "name": "update",
  "safe": false,
  "parameters": [
    {
      "name": "nefFile",
      "type": "ByteArray"
    },
    {
      "name": "manifest",
      "type": "ByteArray"
    },
    {
      "name": "data",
      "type": "Any"
    }
  ],
  "returntype": "Void"
}
</pre>

This method MUST call <code>update</code> method in native <code>ContractManagement</code> contract. It will update contract state if it's executed successfully.

Calls to this method MUST have <code>nefFile</code> or <code>manifest</code>. These are serialized representations of NEF ([https://github.com/neo-project/proposals/blob/master/nep-16.mediawiki NEP-16] and NeoContract manifest ([https://github.com/neo-project/proposals/blob/master/nep-15.mediawiki NEP-15]). Omitting one of them (setting to null) is a valid call, this means no changes to this component (old version is kept). These two parameters MUST be passed into <code>ContractManagement</code>'s <code>update</code> method.

The parameter <code>data</code> can be any type of supported parameters for contract-specific purpose. For [https://github.com/nspcc-dev/neofs-contract/blob/99fb86c35a48ed12017423aa4fee13f7d07fa4c0/contracts/proxy/contract.go#L33 example] some kinds of parameters can be put into data for specific check. See [https://github.com/neo-project/proposals/blob/master/nep-29.mediawiki NEP-29] for additional reference on contract update callback mechanism that works with this parameter.

This method SHOULD do <code>Checkwitness</code> for contract <code>owner</code> to avoid security risks. This function SHOULD use the SYSCALL <code>Neo.Runtime.CheckWitness</code> to verify the <code>signer</code>. 

It's strongly recommended to execute all codes before calling <code>ContractManagement</code>'s <code>update</code> method to ensure they can be executed correctly.
