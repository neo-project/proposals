==Abstract==

This proposal outlines a token standard for the NEO blockchain that will provide systems with a generalized interaction mechanism for tokenized Smart Contracts.  This mechanic, along with the justification for each feature are defined.  A template and examples are also provided to enable the development community.

==Motivation==

As the NEO blockchain scales, Smart Contract deployment and invocation will become increasingly important.  Without a standard interaction method, systems will be required to maintain a unique API for each contract, regardless of their similarity to other contracts.  Tokenized contracts present themselves as a prime example of this need because their basic operating mechanism is the same.  A standard method for interacting with these tokens relieves the entire ecosystem from maintaining a definition for basic operations that are required by every Smart Contract that employs a token.

==Specification==

In the method definitions below, we provide both the definitions of the functions as they are defined in the contract as well as the invoke parameters.

===Methods===

====symbol====

<pre>
public static string symbol()
</pre>

Returns a short string symbol of the token managed in this contract. e.g. <code>"MYT"</code>. This symbol SHOULD be short (3-8 characters is recommended), with no whitespace characters or new-lines and SHOULD be limited to the uppercase latin alphabet (i.e. the 26 letters used in English).

This method MUST always return the same value every time it is invoked.

====decimals====

<pre>
public static byte decimals()
</pre>

Returns the number of decimals used by the token - e.g. <code>8</code>, means to divide the token amount by <code>100,000,000</code> to get its user representation.

This method MUST always return the same value every time it is invoked.

====totalSupply====

<pre>
public static BigInteger totalSupply()
</pre>

Returns the total token supply deployed in the system.

====balanceOf====

<pre>
public static BigInteger balanceOf(byte[] account)
</pre>

Returns the token balance of the <code>account</code>.

The parameter <code>account</code> MUST be a 20-byte address. If not, this method SHOULD <code>throw</code> an exception.

If the <code>account</code> is an unused address, this method MUST return <code>0</code>.

====transfer====

<pre>
public static bool transfer(byte[] from, byte[] to, BigInteger amount)
</pre>

Transfers an <code>amount</code> of tokens from the <code>from</code> account to the <code>to</code> account.

The parameters <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> MUST be 20-byte addresses. If not, this method SHOULD <code>throw</code> an exception.

The parameter <code>amount</code> MUST be greater than or equal to <code>0</code>. If not, this method SHOULD <code>throw</code> an exception.

The function MUST return <code>false</code> if the <code>from</code> account balance does not have enough tokens to spend.

If the method succeeds, it MUST fire the <code>transfer</code> event, and MUST return <code>true</code>, even if the <code>amount</code> is <code>0</code>, or <code>from</code> and <code>to</code> are the same address.

The function SHOULD check whether the <code>from</code> address equals the caller contract hash. If so, the transfer SHOULD be processed; If not, the function SHOULD use the SYSCALL <code>Neo.Runtime.CheckWitness</code> to verify the transfer.

If the transfer is not processed, the function MUST return <code>false</code>.

If the receiver is a deployed contract, the function MUST call <code>onPayment</code> method on receiver contract AFTER firing the <code>Transfer</code> event. If the receiver doesn't want to receive this transfer it MUST call <code>ABORT</code>.

<pre>
public static void onPayment(BigInteger amount)
</pre>

===Events===

====Transfer====

<pre>
public static event Transfer(byte[] from, byte[] to, BigInteger amount)
</pre>

MUST trigger when tokens are transferred, including zero value transfers and self-transfers.

A token contract which creates new tokens MUST trigger a <code>Transfer</code> event with the <code>from</code> address set to <code>null</code> when tokens are created.

A token contract which burns tokens MUST trigger a <code>Transfer</code> event with the <code>to</code> address set to <code>null</code> when tokens are burned.
