==Abstract==

The NEP-5 Proposal outlines a token standard for the NEO blockchain that will provide systems with a generalized interaction mechanism for tokenized Smart Contracts.  This mechanic, along with the justification for each feature are defined.  A template and examples are also provided to enable the development community.

==Motivation==

As the NEO blockchain scales, Smart Contract deployment and invocation will become increasingly important.  Without a standard interaction method, systems will be required to maintain a unique API for each contract, regardless of their similarity to other contracts.  Tokenized contracts present themselves as a prime example of this need because their basic operating mechanism is the same.  A standard method for interacting with these tokens relieves the entire ecosystem from maintaining a definition for basic operations that are required by every Smart Contract that employs a token.

==Specification==

In the method definitions below, we provide both the definitions of the functions as they are defined in the contract as well as the invoke parameters.

===Methods===

====totalSupply====

* Syntax: <code>public static BigInteger totalSupply()</code>

* Remarks: "totalSupply" returns the total token supply deployed in the system.

====name====

* Syntax: <code>public static string name()</code>

* Remarks: "name" returns the token name.


====symbol====

* Syntax: <code>public static string symbol()</code>

* Remarks: "symbol" returns the token symbol.

====decimals====

* Syntax: <code>public static byte decimals()</code>

* Remarks: "decimals" returns the number of decimals used by the token.

====balanceOf====

* Syntax: <code>public static BigInteger balanceOf(byte[] account)</code>

* Remarks: "balanceOf" returns the token balance of the '''account'''.

====transfer====

* Syntax: <code>public static bool transfer(byte[] from, byte[] to, BigInteger amount)</code>

* Remarks: "transfer" will transfer an '''amount''' of tokens from the '''from''' account to the '''to''' account.

====allowance====

* Syntax: <code>public static BigInteger allowance(byte[] from, byte[] to)</code>

* Remarks: "allowance" will return the amount of tokens that the '''to''' account can transfer from the '''from''' acount.

====transferFrom====

* Syntax: <code>public static bool transferFrom(byte[] originator, byte[] from, byte[] to, BigInteger amount)</code>

* Remarks: "transferFrom" will transfer an '''amount''' from the '''from''' account to the '''to''' acount if the '''originator''' has been approved to transfer the requested '''amount'''.

====approve====

* Syntax: <code>public static bool approve(byte[] originator, byte[] to, BigInteger amount)</code>

* Remarks: "approve" will approve the '''to''' account to transfer '''amount''' tokens from the '''originator''' acount. 

===Events===

====transfer====

* Syntax: <code>public static event Action<byte[], byte[], BigInteger> transfer</code>

* Remarks: The "transfer" event is raised after a successful execution of the "transfer" method.

==Implementation==

*[[nep-5/NEP5Template.cs|C#]]

*[[nep-5/NEP5Template.py|Python]]
